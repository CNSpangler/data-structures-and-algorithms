## Array-Map
### Instructions: Write a function called map which takes an array and a function as arguments. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the function applied to each element.
### Whiteboard: 
    Have to use a for loop, that's the only way to iterate without methods
    How to get stuff into an array without .push?
    Define a new empty array within the function that takes the array and callback as   parameters
    use array.length to set the index of each item in the for loop
    call the callback function on each item and insert into the new array
    return the new array
